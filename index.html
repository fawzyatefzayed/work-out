                <h3>THE Computer</h3>
        <P CLASS="PR1">Computer : is an electronic device that operates (works) under the control of programs stored in its own memory unit.
        A computer is an electronic machine that processes raw data to give information as output.
        An electronic device that accepts data as input, and transforms it under the influence of a set of special instructions called Programs, to produce the desired output (referred to as Information).

<P class="PR2">
        A computer system has three main components: hardware, software, and people. The equipment associated with a computer system is called hardware. Software is a set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. People, however, are the most important component of a computer system - people use the power of the computer for some purpose. In fact, this course will show you that the computer can be a tool for just about anyone from a business person, to an artist, to a housekeeper, to a student - an incredibly powerful and flexible tool.
